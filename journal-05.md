## Today I learned

For loops are a great way to go through items in lists and get the data you need to work with , which you can either pass into another function, or just return.

That was a long way of saying that for loops are super useful! 

## Reflection

My why for becoming a software engineer is still the same.  My why for learning aobut for loops and such is that I can use these different tools to successfully accomplish things with code.
