Today was a great day!  Coding in pairs was a wonderful experience getting to talk with someone one-on-one and bounce ideas off of each other's brains.  Also, by having one person Navigate and the other Drive, it was a really good exercise in learning how to communicate clearly and effectively about code.  At first, all of the jargon and super-specific terms seem like over-kill, but as I've learned a little bit more, I can see how that because the things we are talking about are so specific, we really do need those specific terms to be able to quickly and effectively communicate with each other. My motivations for learning to code are: #1  To get a well-paid job by having a skill that is in high demand. #2  To get in a career path where I can learn throughout my career and things are different and changing all the time.
