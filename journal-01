### Planning and Evaluating Learning

I see myself planning and evaluating what I learn on a regular basis a couple of different ways.  First, for planning, because it is so early in my learning journey, I'm very open to whatever topics are presented in the curriculum and I have a  high level of trust in whatever the instructional staff encourage me to learn.  As I progress through the program, I'm sure I will naturally tend toward interest in a few different topics, but I also recognize that I want to have well-rounded practical knowledge, and I trust the instructors to point me in the right directions.

When it comes to evaluating my learning, I think the journals and labs will be great to look back on and see what I was learning and working on when.  I'll try to record "lightbulb moments" in my journals.
