Today was a lot of learning about local storage and how it can be used and updated.  I'm trying to think of other uses for local storage besides a shopping cart.  I'm sure there are lots of different reasons to use it.  It kind of feels like this third place that we can't fully control from our side as web developers.  For example, I don't think the price should ever be put in local storage, or else the customer could mess with us.  I mean, the customer could edit the price before checking out and essentially hack our cart.
