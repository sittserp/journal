### Curiosity

I would say that my biggest internal force for learning is curiosity.  When things don't make sense to me, I have a drive to figure them out.  The most satisfying thing is when I finally understand a complex problem or way of solving something that was a mystery to me before.  Today I got a lot of that with learning how to generate DOM elements with JS and loop through arrays in a practical way to make the project scalable.
