Today had a lot of learning in it.  The shopping cart has a lot of moving pieces with a lot of different work being done in different places. The biggest takeaway for me is breaking down everything into small steps and doing better planning from the beginning and also as I work my way through different tasks.  I think I'm getting the main outline planned out well, but all the sub-headings should be better fleshed out as well before I start wondering what to do next and feeling stuck. I need to remember to pause, take a step back, and think, 'What is the smallest step that this action can be broken down into?'
